**The World Cup of Hockey Returns in 2028: A Fresh Start in Hockey History**

The snowflakes of excitement are falling in Montreal, as the NHL and NHL Players' Association announced today that the World Cup of Hockey will make its return in 2028, just two years after a thrilling tournament in 2026.

The highly anticipated event is set to kick off in February 2028, building on the success of the 4 Nations Face-Off, a revised iteration of the original tournament. The 4 Nations Face-Off will feature nations from North America and Europe competing on two impressive NHL-sized rinks, backed by official NHL officials.

In a testament to the excitement in Montreal, the 2028 World Cup will be joined by the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics and 2030 French Alps Olympics, creating a schedule that will take the hockey world on a rollercoaster ride of adrenaline.

But beyond the thrill and competition, the World Cup of Hockey is coming at a pivotal time for hockey. The current collective bargaining agreement will expire in September of 2026, leaving room for new deals to be negotiated. Hockey insiders are eager to see fresh faces on the ice and a return to the old glory days.

Speaking to the press about the upcoming tournament, the NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman expressed his enthusiasm for the return of the World Cup of Hockey. "We are moving forward with the World Cup two years after the Olympics in 2028," he said. "We will be asking for bids on hosting games, and we will have a package that's just about done, which will be done in the next few weeks."

The players themselves are thrilled at the prospect of competing in the World Cup of Hockey once more. NHL Players' Association executive director Marty Walsh believes that the tournament will be a "sampler" with NHL players starting to show the best on ice once again.

"It's great," said Sweden's Erik Karlsson, "something that we've missed for a long period of time. If we can get to a schedule where every second year there's big tournament played, I think that's ideal for everyone."

The 2028 World Cup of Hockey will be shaped by a rigorous bidding process and consultation with key stakeholders, with a focus on international best-on-best competition every two years after the 2030 Olympics.

The NHL-NHLPA partnership has made significant strides in recent years, with last year's successful partnership between the two organizations helping to usher in a new era of hockey. As the tournaments return to the ice, fans can expect to see fresh uniforms, updated branding, and a renewed sense of urgency for the next generation of hockey players.

For now, the focus is on the excitement of the upcoming World Cup of Hockey, and the NHL and NHLPA are committed to delivering it in style.

**How it ends...**

The NHL-NHLPA will continue work on the tickets, broadcast details, and fan engagement for the 2028 World Cup of Hockey, with new initiatives in place to grow interest and support throughout the season.

The showdown between Sean Strickland and Dricus Du Plessis at UFC 312 was supposed to be a stepping stone to bigger things. However, a heated exchange between the two over the phone ended with Du Plessis's coach, Eric Nicksick, speaking his mind, much to Strickland's dismay.

The 29-7 MMA fighter got into a public spat with Nicksick, who had been his cornerman since his big UFC title fight against Israel Adesanya. But it was more than just criticism – it was a slap in the face. Strickland vented about Du Plessis's performance, which was rocky from start to finish, and Nicksick defended his coaching decisions, saying that he was just trying to win the big fight.

The rift between them just escalated the tension, with Strickland revealing that his personal relationship with Nicksick will remain intact, but his professional one may not. "I like Eric, he's a friend of mine," he said, eyeing a witticism. "He's going to continue to be a friend of mine. Will he probably be in my corner? Probably not."

The jab at Nicksick has sent shockwaves through the lightweight division, with many taking to social media to express their solidarity with Strickland.

"I'm feeling the heat, Eric had me doubting my title reign at some point lol" one supporter tweeted, accompanied by a photo of Strickland flexing his arms.

Du Plessis's coach, on the other hand, is standing firm, having pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering earlier this year.

Tensions will be running high come UFC 312, where both fighters will be on the line for the finish. Let's see what happens next in this ongoing feud between Strickland and Nicksick.

A rollercoaster of emotions as Bayern Munich took to the pitch, only to falter in a jarring display of inconsistency. At 2-0 up against Celtic Park, it seemed as good as it would have been for the German giants to end the match on a flurry of goals. Instead, a shocking turn of events gripped the club, leaving fans stunned (yet expecting too much).

What unfolded next will forever be remembered as one of the most unpredictable finishes to a Champions League game in recent times. Like a puzzle stuck on an indefinite break, the Bavarian team stumbled to safety, ultimately conjuring up a 2-1 aggregate advantage ahead of their next match.

**The Uprising**

In the 45th minute, Ma Xabi, Bayern's 23-year-old, took the lead with a stunning curling goal set up beautifully by Michael Olise. Yet, before Celtic could truly breathe, the momentum shifted back in Bayern's favor - in a magnificent finishing of two goals.

Eric Dier, an opponent seemingly synonymous with calmness, proved otherwise, getting increasingly agitated as Bayern dwelled on the sidelines. Amidst the tumultuous end of the game, Dayot Upamecano and Kim Min-jae emerged as the centre-back duo providing the most physical toughness.

**The Unwanted Supporting Players**

Vincent Kompany's exuberant pressing system played an unprecedentedly vital role in securing the German win. His high-pressing strategy, expertly implemented to combat Celtic's relentless attacks, often isolating opponents and finding the weaknesses of stubborn no-man's-land.

However, even the stalwart day-night centre-backs couldn't stem the wave of adversity head-on. This puzzling display sparked concern among fans accustomed to watching Bayern steel their resolve for victories under one of the most demanding teams in European major competitions.<br><a href="https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2025/2/13/24364421/observations-match-analysis-ucl-champions-league-bayern-munich-celtic-olise-kane-upamecano-dier" target="_blank">Three Observations from Bayern Munich’s 2-1 win against Celtic - Bavarian Football Works</a><br><br><br>
