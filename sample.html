**Get ready for the biggest news in hockey – the NHL and NHL Players' Association are finalizing plans for the
2028 World Cup of Hockey. This tournament will return on **February 26, 2028**, in February of that year,
sandwiched between the **2026 Milano Cortina Olympics** and the **2030 French Alps Olympics**.

**The Format: A Game-Changer**

This time, a **<font color="blue">4 Nations Face-Off</font>**, featuring teams from four countries – Canada, Sweden, the
United States, and Norway – will be held in
Montreal and Boston. The tournament will bring back classic best-on-best hockey, alternating between NHL and
international
teams.

**Who's in the Inaugural Class?**

The 2028 tournament is expected to feature only teams from individual countries, unlike the 2016 World Cup of Hockey's
player-blended format. The NHL and NHLPA will monitor international events before making a final decision on Russia's
participation.

**International Federation Response**

Russia and Belarus remain suspended from international competition due to ongoing conflict with Ukraine. The NHL and
NHLPA
will work with the International Ice Hockey Federation to determine Russian players' eligibility for participation.

**The Objective: To Bring Drama and Excitement**

The objective is to create an international best-on-best competition every two years, featuring the world's top hockey
players.
This would undoubtedly thrill hockey fans and provide an opportunity for memorable moments like the 2010 golden goal.

**Signs of a Big-Brick Push**

The NHL and NHLPA will continue working together to finalize details, including participating teams, tournament dates,
times,
broadcast information, training camp dates, and more. Each side hopes to reach a deal by the end of the season or
shortly after.

**A Legacy to be Built**

The **2028 World Cup of Hockey** would solidify the relationship between the NHL and the NHLPA and provide a platform
for showcasing top talent.
With its international best-on-best format and timely return, this event has the potential to attract fans worldwide.

**What's Next?**

After the conclusion of the 4 Nations Face-Off and any negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement, Iconic hockey
episodes,
such as recaps, stats, and player profiles, will be listed on **Records.NHL.com**.

The Coaching Confrontation: Sean Strickland's Cringeworthy Response to Coach Eric Nicksick


The sweet taste of victory was short-lived for UFC 312, as hometown hero Sean Strickland nearly quit the sport
after a cracking five-round unanimous decision loss to Dricus Du Plessis. The bout, a former middleweight champion, was
supposed
to be a rematch against his previous teammate, Du Plessis, but it turned out to be a far cry from what Strickland had
envisioned.
His feelings of frustration were magnified when his coach, Eric Nicksick, called out Strickland's lackluster performance
under pressure.

In a candid interview, Nicksick criticized Strickland for prioritizing profits over performance, a message that left the
UFC fighter
reeling. Strickland couldn't help but fire back, claiming that Nicksick's disapproval stems from a desire to be a "world
champion,
not just for the sake of making money."

The tension was palpable, and it seems that a long-standing friendship between Strickland and Nicksick may be put to the
test.
While it's likely that both fighters will survive their respective beefs without being annihilated, their professional
relationship may take
a hit. As one fan quipped, a new era of friendship may be dawning in the Octagon – one fueled by a healthy dose of
rivalry.


Exclusive Reaction

Strickland: "He's a friend of mine. He's going to continue to be a friend of mine. I like Eric. He's a friend. But as
far as our
professional relationship, it seems that the two sides may splinter for the time being."

Nicksick: "I think he needs to evaluate what he wants to do in this sport. If it's just to make money, then that's
great. Let us know. I
want to coach world champions, so my motivations are different. So I think that just to kind of show up and do that, and
not really
back it up, to me was just kind of uninspiring."
<b>Bayern Munich Undefeated in Debate with a Thrilling Victory</b>


Bayern Munich, looking like a juggernaut on paper, was forced to play a nervy second-half stoppage time that could have
ended in disaster.
Yes, that's right – 2.0.

Facing a Celtic side invigorated by their home support, Bayern looked utterly rattled, struggling to find their rhythm
and creating
mere fleeting moments of ourability as they tried to chip away at their advantage.

Unbelievably, however, the unthinkable happened: a defensive misstep from Daizen Maeda led to a magical moment by
Michael Olise and then cobbled together by an increasingly entangled Adam Idah – the left foot of Olise rocketing goal
seemingly blocked by the selfsame Idah!**

To make matters worse, shortly after Olise's miracle goal, an unassuming Daizen Maeda slammed home his second, securing
yet
another result – this 2-1 victory. Only a few dream scenarios remain for Bayern fans now – will they be able to keep
their momentum
going?

Meanwhile, another sensational hero of the night stepped forward to finish off Celtic Park – Dayot Upamecano and the
equally
unorthodox Kim Min-jae have showcased their prowess as an unparalleled defensive duo this season!

However, a stark difference has come to light – Dayot Upamecano and Kim Min-jae seem better equipped than their
counterpart
the other German international – Eric Dier, far too passive and ineffective to face Ciaran McCartney and Santi Cazorla.
